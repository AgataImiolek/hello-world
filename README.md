 "Hello World!"
Hello world! I am Agata, I am a third year chemistry student in UK, from Poland. I enjoy new challenges which is why I am learning how to code using the IBM Python Basics for Data Science offered on the edX website, which is also where I have discovered GitHub and learned about the importance of it.
